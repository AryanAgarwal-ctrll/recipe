1 brown paper lunch bag
½ cup uncooked popcorn kernels
1 tsp popcorn popping oil
1 tsp popcorn seasoning
In a small bowl combine the kernels, oil, and salt until the kernels are fully coated. 
Pour into your paper lunch bag and fold the top of the bag over three times to secure it. 
Cook on high for 2 ½ - 3 minutes or until there’s about 2 seconds between each pop. 
Pour into a bowl immediately and allow it to sit for 1 minute before tasting and adding extra seasoning if you like.
